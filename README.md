# TYMN, A Facial Recognition Student Attendance Checker

## Introduction
Developed as a school project. Tymn uses a pre-trained AI to recognize students' faces recorded in a database to take their attendance if previous records are found, if not, uses their facial data to register them as a new student. Also has the ability to use your Android phone's camera for the facial recognition.
